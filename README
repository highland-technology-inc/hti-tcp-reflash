hti-tcp-reflash
===============

**AS-IS** code that reflashes various Highland Technology products over a
local TCP/IP network using their serial protocol. It was written
specifically on Xubuntu 16.04, using a familiar socket API (sys/socket.h,
*et al.*).

Consider this to be “pre-alpha” example code.

This code is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but *WITHOUT

Building
========

.. note::

You will first need to run the command:

::

   autoreconf -i

which requires autotools and libtool to be installed on your computer.

The generic instructions for configuring this source tree for your
computer are in the file INSTALL in this directory.  Briefly, the
shell commands are:

::

    $ ./configure  # or "configure --prefix=/your/preffered/path"
    $ make
    $ make install  # or more likely "sudo make install"

This will install into your /usr/local/ directory by default.
Note that the default installation is not always the best.  Some Linux
distributions will require you to either modify your LD_LIBRARY_PATH or
use a different installation path (the "--prefix" argument) for the
shared-object libraries to work.  You may also need to add to MANPATH.

Read INSTALL for more information.

Documentation
=============

The man page is in the ``man/`` directory.  It is installed with the
binaries. To read it without installing, try one of:

::

   man ./man/hti-tcp-reflash.1

or

::

  groff -Tascii -mman ./man/hti-tcp-reflash.1 | less

Portability
===========

This was written specifically for Xubuntu 16.04.  It might work on other
POSIX-compliant environments, but some tweaking could be necessary.
