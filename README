hti-tcp-reflash
===============

**AS-IS** code that reflashes various Highland Technology products over a
local TCP/IP network using their serial protocol. It was written
specifically on Xubuntu 16.04, using a familiar socket API (sys/socket.h,
*et al.*).

  This code is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
  *WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY*; without even the implied warranty of
  *MERCHANTABILITY* or *FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE*. See COPYING
  for more details.

Building
========

.. note::

   If you got this code using git instead of receiving a tarball package
   from Highland Technology, you will first need to run the command

   ::

      autoreconf -i

   You will need autotools and libtool to be installed on your computer.

The generic instructions for configuring this source tree for your
computer are in the file INSTALL in this directory.  Briefly, the
shell commands are:

::

    $ ./configure  # or "configure --prefix=/your/preffered/path"
    $ make
    $ make install  # or more likely "sudo make install"

This will install into your /usr/local/ directory by default.
Note that the default installation is not always the best.  Some Linux
distributions will require you to either modify your LD_LIBRARY_PATH or
use a different installation path (the "--prefix" argument) for the
shared-object libraries to work.  You may also need to add to MANPATH
so see the man pages.

Read INSTALL for more information.

Documentation
=============

Man pages are in the ``man/`` directory.  They are installed with the
binaries. To read them without installing, for example hti-tcp-reflash
(1), try one of:

::

   man ./man/hti-tcp-reflash.1

or

::

  groff -Tascii -mman ./man/hti-tcp-reflash.1 | less

Portability
===========

This was written specifically for Xubuntu 16.04.  It may work on other
POSIX-compliant environments, but some tweaking may be necessary.
